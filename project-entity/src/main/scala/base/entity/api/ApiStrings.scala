/**
 * Container for strings used in API Documentation, specifically in the annotations used
 *  by Swagger. Unfortunately, annotations values must be final and must be primitive - meaning
 *  no string composition, no pulling from conf files, no ingenious language solutions.
 *  Still better than hand-maintaining docs.
 *
 * Coverage is turned off since the cov module can't determine whether final vals have been covered (weak, I know)
 *
 * NB: ALL STRINGS IN THIS FILE ARE CONSTANT - there is no interpolation or concatenation. This rule is required
 *     because many of these strings are used in annotations for swagger, and annotations must be constant native
 *     strings at the pre-compile stage.
